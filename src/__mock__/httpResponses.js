              'This golf club his family is part of had an event. Not only did his family go, but extended family and family friends went too.\n\nI was sitting at a table with his family. It was a nice event, but I was not the target demographic of the music that was being played. Which was okay, I still did a polite nod and smile when his parents told me about "real music".\n\nThen some throwback music was being played, but it was music I was unfamiliar with (90\'s rock). Then they played a classic New Edition song I loved. I took my boyfriend to the dance floor and we had a lot of fun. I was already on the dance-floor when SOMEHOW a Snoop Dogg song came on.\n\nMy dad put me on a lot of OG rappers of the west coast. We are in no way and never have been affiliated with any gangs. I have never touched a drug in my life. But when Snoop comes on, you crip-walk. It\'s like the cha-cha slide in our house. Old school hiphop is our chicken dance. So I did. It was fun, the younger people were going crazy and trying to do it. The dance kinda came back because of rappers like blueface.\n\nHonestly, I love getting a chance to crip-walk because it\'s silly and I\'m really good at it. I also throw in other dance moves in there too. But that\'s all it is, an old dance move with my spin to it.\n\nWhen the song was done, I went over to my boyfriends table. His dad asked where I learned how to dance like that. I told him about my dad. My boyfriend looked really upset and I asked him what was wrong. He said he was fine.  We texted, got up in a bit and went outside the hall to talk.\n\nHe was calm, but I could tell he was irritated. He said I need to be aware of how others see me and not purposefully do shit to make things worse. I asked him what he was talking about. He his family already knows about where I live and I should have been on "my best behaviour". But I was a "walking stereotype" instead.\n\nI realized what he was talking about and got upset. I said I was just dancing. He said I embarrassed him in front of everyone he knows and basically told his family my dad was a gang member. He said I made myself look like one.\n\nHe said I\'m supposed to fight stereotypes not feed into them. Especially if I demand respect. I can\'t act classless.\n\nBut I was just dancing, others were attempting to crip-walk too. This doesn\'t include all the younger people trying to do the "thotiana" shit. I asked why it\'s an issue when I did it. He said I know why.\n\nI told him I was going home.\n\nHe asked me to go back inside and forget about it. I told him that I wanted to go home. Especially if I\'m an embarrassment. He was apologizing and said that\'s not what he meant. I really could see the regret in his face.\n\nHe offered to at least drop me off and I told him I\'ll get an uber. He wouldn\'t drop the idea of driving me home and kept insisting. I said that he didn\'t want to be "in a classless, gangster traphouse." He told me not to be like that and that\'s not what he meant.\n\nI told him we could talk the next day, but I was leaving. He tried following me out, but I did raise my voice and tell him to leave me alone. I feel bad for raising my voice, but no one was around and he wasn\'t leaving me alone.\n\nI\'m upset and hurt. But I think he did have a point. I do see where I made a mistake, it wasn\'t a good idea to crip-walk at golf club, but younger people were doing all types of dance. But the dance I did have a gang name in it. I did need to be more aware of my surroundings.\n\nHe wants to talk about what happened now, but I just need to clear my head first before going in.\n\n**Edit: This is going to sound corny but...I went away from this post and was talking to my friends about this. I was sad until I remembered who I was lmao. I do not and will not tolerate this kind of disrespect. It\'s not how I was raised, It\'s not who I want to be.** I won\'t lose myself to appease a boy. \n\n**I\'m ending things because he does not respect me as an individual, just the sanitized version. I\'m embarrassed that I even had to make this post. That said, thank you all for your input. Let\'s hope I keep the same energy when it\'s time to actually do it.**\n\nThat said, I understand why he was uncomfortable, but he can express that without belittling me.\n\n**Also this edit happened hours afterwards so Iâ€™m not sure if I still keep this up.**',
